| Where does a tie’s bridgingness come from? When and why can people build bridges? Ad-dressing these questions may help uncover the origins of structural connectedness between people of different backgrounds and/or preferences in a way that does not reinforce existing segregation, norms, or inequality (Blau & Schwartz 1984; cf. Centola 2015). | \-   | [[私人筆記/李樹論文/✍️ Notes/在何時、何地，由誰來建立橋接\|188]]                                                  | 1        |
