## My Review



> [!NOTE] 不可能三角形意謂著存在「橋」
>  橋（bridge）是兩點之間唯一路徑的線（最短路徑的線），使得橋兩端的行動者只能透過橋來傳遞資訊和影響力。

> The significance  of this triad's absence  can  be shown  by using the concept  of  a  "bridge"; this  is a  line in  a  network  which provides  the  only path  between  two points  (Harary,  Norman,  and  Cartwright  1965, p.  198). Since, in  general,  each person  has  a  great  many  contacts,  a  bridge  between A  and  B  provides  the  only  route  along which information  or  influence can flow from  any  contact  of  A  to  any  contact  of  B,  and,  consequently,  from anyone connected indirectly  to A  to anyone connected indirectly  to B.  Thus, in  the  study  of  diffusion, we  can  expect  bridges  to  assume  an  important role.
