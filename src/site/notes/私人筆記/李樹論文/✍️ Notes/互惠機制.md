> Reciprocity appears to occur for several reasons. In interpersonal relationships, oneway ties are likely to become reciprocal because people tend to like others who like them (Newcomb 1956, Backman & Secord 1959, Sprecher 1998, Montoya & Insko 2008).Similarly, reciprocation relative to a first advance of friendship decreases the chance of being rebuffed (Goffman 1963)
