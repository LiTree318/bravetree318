Whatever results are inferred from this supposition should tend to occur in the degree that the triad in question tends to be absent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Since, in general, each person has a great many contacts, a bridge between A and B provides the only route along which information or influence can flow from any contact of A to any contact of B, and, consequently, from anyone connected indirectly to A to anyone connected indirectly to B. Thus, in the study of diffusion, we can expect bridges to assume an important role. |

Of  those  finding  a  job  through  con-tacts,  16.7%  reported  that  they  saw their  contact  often  at  the  time,  55.6% said occasionally, and  27.8%  rarely  (N  = 54). 16  The  skew is clearly  to  the weak  end  of the continuum, suggesting  the primacy of structure over motivation.== In  many  cases, the  contact*
