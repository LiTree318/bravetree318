| *Clustering means that social networks tend to have a high density of closed triads, or, colloquially, people tend to become friends with the friends of their friends. ...... Granovetter(1973, p. 1362) suggested that people ate inclined to create ties with the friends of their friends people who spend time with a common third are likely to incidentally encounter each other, even if they are not explicitly introduced (cf. Feld 1997). Others have noted that ==sharing a third party provides information about potential connections through referrals and gossip and that this information eases the process of developing a new tie by decreasing the uncertainty and risk of a new connection== (Burt & Knez 1995).*                        | 叢集效應分兩個部分，一個是叢集中其他行動者的介紹（互動）有助於提高建立新關係的確定性；另一個效應則叢集中的其他行動者作為「第三方」，能提供其他資訊以便行動者降低陌生和作者的不確定性。                           | [[私人筆記/李樹論文/✍️ Notes/叢集（clustering）效應\|100]]                          | 1        |  #叢集_Cluster #第三方                                |

| *Kogut et al. (2007) examined the emergence of the U.S. venture capital syndication network and found that new entrant firms sometimes entered the network with more cutting-edge knowledge and consequently surpassed some incumbent firms in the number of partners they accumulated. Whether a preference for novelty may similarly enable some individuals—for example, rising stars—to surpass incumbents in the extent of their connectedness is a relatively unexplored area.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Kogut et al.

| *they are also more likely to form attach-ments with each other—popular actors attach to other popular actors, whereas lower-degree actors tend to attach to other low-degree actors......They encountered an interesting result: Among eight of the elite individuals who had ties to multiple organizations within the community of 50,000 people, 53 of 56 possible social ties existed. In other words, each of the eight elite individuals named nearly all of the other eight as people they saw socially. This finding supported assortativity among elite actors, but also strongly suggested that the most well-connected individuals in the community preferred to attach to other well-connected individuals.*                                      | 用節點數量區分不同的互動群體，高連結會與高連結，低連結與低連結。可以參考Podolny討論的「地位」（status）                                                            | [[私人筆記/李樹論文/✍️ Notes/節點的連結數可以區分不同「群體」的節點群體\|104]]                     | 0        |                                                  |

| *Reciprocity appears to occur for several reasons. In interpersonal relationships, oneway ties are likely to become reciprocal because people tend to like others who like them (Newcomb 1956, Backman & Secord 1959, Sprecher 1998, Montoya & Insko 2008).Similarly, reciprocation relative to a first advance of friendship decreases the chance of being rebuffed (Goffman 1963)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 這邊描述的是互惠機制：人更傾向跟對自己好的人、或者跟自己相似性高的人相處，這樣更不容易被拒絕。                                                                       | [[私人筆記/李樹論文/✍️ Notes/互惠機制\|98]]                                       | 0        |  #relational_mechanism                           |
| *One-way friendships were approximately two times more likely to entirely dissolve than they were to be reciprocated.
