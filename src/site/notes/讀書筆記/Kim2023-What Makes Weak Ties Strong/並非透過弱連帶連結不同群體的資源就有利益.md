## My Review



> [!NOTE] 並非透過弱連帶連結不同群體的資源就有利益
>  Granovetter晚期的作品（1985）也指出弱連帶的優勢會與橋接不同群體（with the structural property of bridging social worlds）有關，而這個可能會與行動者的能動性有關。
> 
> 這很重要→並非透過弱連帶連結不同群體的資源就有利益。
> 
> ==可是==：這個與我要討論的無關；這篇文章沒有討論連帶形成的因素與機制，或者類別。

## Quotations

> [!QUOTE] Pages  178
> This exercise ultimately suggests that underlying the SWT thesis may be an “overstructured”view of human action (cf. Granovetter 1985) and that the strength of weak ties coming from their structural property as bridges should be considered against agency with which people use their social networks.
